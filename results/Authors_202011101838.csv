29,Ambrose Bierce,"Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (June 24, 1842 - circa 1914) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist, and satirist. He wrote the short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and compiled a satirical lexicon, The Devil's Dictionary. His vehemence as a critic, his motto Nothing matters, and the sardonic view of human nature that informed his work, all earned him the nickname Bitter Bierce.  Despite his reputation as a searing critic, Bierce was known to encourage younger writers, including the poets George Sterling and Herman George Scheffauer and the fiction writer W. C. Morrow. Bierce employed a distinctive style of writing, especially in his stories. His style often embraces an abrupt beginning, dark imagery, vague references to time, limited descriptions, impossible events, and the theme of war.  In 1913, Bierce traveled to Mexico to gain first-hand experience of the Mexican Revolution. He was rumored to be traveling with rebel troops, and was not seen again.                        "

A prolific author, Lang published more than 100 works during his career, including twelve fairy books, in which he compiled folk and fairy tales from around the world. Lang s Lilac Fairy and Red Fairy books are credited with influencing J. R. R.

Although he began his career as a Unitarian minister, he gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism instead. Seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, he disseminated his thoughts through published essays and public lectures across the United States.

82,Maurus JÃ kai,"Móric Jókay de Ásva (1825 - 1904), outside Hungary also known as Maurus Jokai, was a Hungarian dramatist and novelist. Jókai was extremely prolific. It was to literature that he continued to devote most of his time and his productiveness after 1870 was stupendous, amounting to some hundreds of volumes. Stranger still, none of this work is slipshod and the best of it deserves to endure. Amongst the finest of his later works may be mentioned the unique and incomparable Az arany ember (A Man of Gold, translated into English, among others, under the title The Man with the Golden Touch), the most popular A koszívu ember fiai (The Heartless Man's Sons), the heroic chronicle of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and A tengerszemu hölgy (Eyes like the Sea), the latter of which won the Academy's prize in 1890. He was also an amateur chess player. His jövo század regénye (The novel of the next century - 1872) is accounted an important early work of Science Fiction though the term did not yet exist at the time. In spite of its romantic trappings, this monumental two-volume novel includes some acute observations and almost prophetic visions, such as the prediction of a revolution in Russia and the establishment of a totalitarian state there, or the arrival of aviation. Because it could be read as a satirical allegory on Leninism and Stalinism in the Soviet Union, the book was banned in Hungary in the decades of the Communist régime. (Its Critical Edition was delayed until 1981.)                        "

1156,John Green Edgar Rice Burroughs,"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) is the creator of Tarzan, one of the most popular fictional characters of all time, and John Carter, hero of the Barsoom science fiction series. Burroughs was a prolific author, writing almost 70 books before his death in 1950, and was one of the first authors to popularize a character across multiple media, as he did with Tarzan s appearance in comic strips, movies, and merchandise. Residing in Hawaii at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, Burroughs was drawn into the Second World War and became one of the oldest war correspondents at the time. Edgar Rice Burroughs s popularity continues to be memorialized through the community of Tarzana, California, which is named after the ranch he owned in the area, and through the Burrough crater on Mars, which was named in his honour.John Green attended a boarding school in Alabama not unlike Alaska's Culver Creek. After graduating from college in 2000, he worked as a chaplain at a children's hospital. His experiences with patients and their families during intense crises solidified his desire to write for teens and inspired him to bring his comic sensibility to a candid novel about the excitement of breaking the rules and the challenge of confronting loss. John now writes for several national magazines, both print and Web-based. He is also a commentator for National Public Radio's afternoon newsmagazine, All Things Considered, and Chicago's NPR affiliate, WBEZ.                        "

As he grew older, he continued to enjoy reading and school. At 14, young Wells quit school to help his struggling family. Fortunately, he received a scholarship in 1883 and began studying science at a school in London. Soon after, Wells started writing.

5607,H. P./ Chambers Lovecraft,"Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) was born in Ohio and served in the Civil War. A lifelong journalist, he disappeared mysteriously in Mexico in 1913 while on his way to meet Pancho Villa’s army. Among his works are two collections of stories, Tales of Soldiers and Civilians and Can Such Things Be?, and a brilliant satire, The Devil’s Dictionary.Algernon Blackwood (1869–1951) was born into an upper-class British family. He emigrated to America at the age of twenty and stayed there some ten years, during which time he worked as a reporter for The New York Evening Sun and The New York Times. When he returned to England he turned to writing fiction and soon made a name for himself with the John Silence stories, which relate the exploits of a psychic detective. Blackwood became famous in later years for playing “the Ghost Man” on BBC radio.R.W. Chambers (1865–1933) was born in Brooklyn and studied at the Art Students League and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, exhibiting in the Salon in 1889. He sold illustrations to fashion magazines in New York City before taking up writing and finding success with his collection of stories The King in Yellow, which includes “The Repairer of Reputations.” In later life Chambers published a number of highly successful popular novels, including The Restless Sex and Police!!!, the proceeds from which allowed him to settle in a mansion in upstate New York, where he devoted himself to hunting and fishing.Walter de la Mare (1876–1956) was one of seven children of an official at the Bank of England. He did not attend university, but worked as a bookkeeper for an oil company for some eighteen years, in the course of which he published the poems and stories that secured his literary reputation. In 1908 a grant from the Civil List allowed him to write full time. De la Mare’s fiction includes the novels The Return and The Memoirs of a Midget, as well as many stories. His poems for children and adults and his brilliantly inventive anthologies were much admired by T.S. Eliot, who became his publisher, and by W.H. Auden.Henry James (1843–1916) was born in New York City. His father was a distinguished theologian and a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg; his older brother William James became one of America’s finest philosophers. James attended Harvard Law School and, with the encouragement of William Dean Howells, took to writing criticism and fiction. After 1866 he lived largely in Europe. His many works include the novels A Portrait of a Lady, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl, as well as many short stories.H.P. Lovecraft (1890–1937) was born and died in Providence, Rhode Island. His father died of syphilis when he was eight years old; his mother was later institutionalized for mental illness; and Lovecraft himself was a sickly child.  In 1913 he joined the United Amateur Press Association, beginning a career as a writer in the course of which he published poems, journalism, and stories. Increasingly drawn to horror fiction, Lovecraft was a regular contributor to the Chicago pulp magazine Weird Tales. His first book-length collection of stories, The Outsider, did not appear until 1939, two years after his death.Arthur Machen (1863–1947) was born in Wales. After failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Surgeons, he worked, not very successfully, as a journalist and translator (most famously of Casanova’s memoirs). A friend of the mystic A.E. Waite and a member of the Order of Golden Dawn,  Machen was deeply interested in the occult. His fiction includes The Great God Pan, The Three Impostors, and The Hill of Dreams. Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) was the son of two traveling actors. Born in Boston, he was orphaned early and adopted by a tobacco exporter in Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia, which he left because of gambling debts, and West Point, from which he was dishonorably discharged. “MS. Found in a Bottle” was Poe’s first significant success, and it helped him to obtain an editorial position on The Southern Literary Messenger in Baltimore, though he was soon fired for drinking. Poe married his thirteen-year-old cousin, Virginia, and moved north, where he lived in New York City and Philadelphia while continuing to produce poems, criticism, and stories at a prodigious rate. After his wife’s death from tuberculosis, Poe’s behavior became increasingly erratic. In 1849 he was found drunk and delirious in a bar in Baltimore, the apparent victim of a political gang that had kept him inebriated while escorting him from ballot station to ballot station to cast repeat votes. He died four days later. M.P. Shiel (1865–1947) was born in the West Indies, the son of a Methodist minister of Irish and African descent. Shiel studied classics at King’s College London, flirted with medicine, then took up journalism. His most popular work in his lifetime was his novel The Yellow Danger, and Shiel, who became increasingly xenophobic over the course of his life, is said to have invented the term “the yellow peril.” His best-known work today is the remarkable apocalyptic fantasy The Purple Cloud. Described by contemporaries as “gorgeously mad,” Shiel had become a reclusive religious maniac by the time of his death. His last book, Jesus, remains unpublished.Bram Stoker (1847–1912) was born in Dublin and studied mathematics at Trinity College, by which time he was already composing horror stories. He published Dracula in 1897. Among Stoker’s other books are The Jewel of Seven Stars and The Lair of the White Worm.D. Thin was born in Grand Island, Nebraska, and studied in Paris.                        "

7012,D. Thin,"Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) was born in Ohio and served in the Civil War. A lifelong journalist, he disappeared mysteriously in Mexico in 1913 while on his way to meet Pancho Villa’s army. Among his works are two collections of stories, Tales of Soldiers and Civilians and Can Such Things Be?, and a brilliant satire, The Devil’s Dictionary.Algernon Blackwood (1869–1951) was born into an upper-class British family. He emigrated to America at the age of twenty and stayed there some ten years, during which time he worked as a reporter for The New York Evening Sun and The New York Times. When he returned to England he turned to writing fiction and soon made a name for himself with the John Silence stories, which relate the exploits of a psychic detective. Blackwood became famous in later years for playing “the Ghost Man” on BBC radio.R.W. Chambers (1865–1933) was born in Brooklyn and studied at the Art Students League and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, exhibiting in the Salon in 1889. He sold illustrations to fashion magazines in New York City before taking up writing and finding success with his collection of stories The King in Yellow, which includes “The Repairer of Reputations.” In later life Chambers published a number of highly successful popular novels, including The Restless Sex and Police!!!, the proceeds from which allowed him to settle in a mansion in upstate New York, where he devoted himself to hunting and fishing.Walter de la Mare (1876–1956) was one of seven children of an official at the Bank of England. He did not attend university, but worked as a bookkeeper for an oil company for some eighteen years, in the course of which he published the poems and stories that secured his literary reputation. In 1908 a grant from the Civil List allowed him to write full time. De la Mare’s fiction includes the novels The Return and The Memoirs of a Midget, as well as many stories. His poems for children and adults and his brilliantly inventive anthologies were much admired by T.S. Eliot, who became his publisher, and by W.H. Auden.Henry James (1843–1916) was born in New York City. His father was a distinguished theologian and a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg; his older brother William James became one of America’s finest philosophers. James attended Harvard Law School and, with the encouragement of William Dean Howells, took to writing criticism and fiction. After 1866 he lived largely in Europe. His many works include the novels A Portrait of a Lady, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl, as well as many short stories.H.P. Lovecraft (1890–1937) was born and died in Providence, Rhode Island. His father died of syphilis when he was eight years old; his mother was later institutionalized for mental illness; and Lovecraft himself was a sickly child.  In 1913 he joined the United Amateur Press Association, beginning a career as a writer in the course of which he published poems, journalism, and stories. Increasingly drawn to horror fiction, Lovecraft was a regular contributor to the Chicago pulp magazine Weird Tales. His first book-length collection of stories, The Outsider, did not appear until 1939, two years after his death.Arthur Machen (1863–1947) was born in Wales. After failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Surgeons, he worked, not very successfully, as a journalist and translator (most famously of Casanova’s memoirs). A friend of the mystic A.E. Waite and a member of the Order of Golden Dawn,  Machen was deeply interested in the occult. His fiction includes The Great God Pan, The Three Impostors, and The Hill of Dreams. Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) was the son of two traveling actors. Born in Boston, he was orphaned early and adopted by a tobacco exporter in Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia, which he left because of gambling debts, and West Point, from which he was dishonorably discharged. “MS. Found in a Bottle” was Poe’s first significant success, and it helped him to obtain an editorial position on The Southern Literary Messenger in Baltimore, though he was soon fired for drinking. Poe married his thirteen-year-old cousin, Virginia, and moved north, where he lived in New York City and Philadelphia while continuing to produce poems, criticism, and stories at a prodigious rate. After his wife’s death from tuberculosis, Poe’s behavior became increasingly erratic. In 1849 he was found drunk and delirious in a bar in Baltimore, the apparent victim of a political gang that had kept him inebriated while escorting him from ballot station to ballot station to cast repeat votes. He died four days later. M.P. Shiel (1865–1947) was born in the West Indies, the son of a Methodist minister of Irish and African descent. Shiel studied classics at King’s College London, flirted with medicine, then took up journalism. His most popular work in his lifetime was his novel The Yellow Danger, and Shiel, who became increasingly xenophobic over the course of his life, is said to have invented the term “the yellow peril.” His best-known work today is the remarkable apocalyptic fantasy The Purple Cloud. Described by contemporaries as “gorgeously mad,” Shiel had become a reclusive religious maniac by the time of his death. His last book, Jesus, remains unpublished.Bram Stoker (1847–1912) was born in Dublin and studied mathematics at Trinity College, by which time he was already composing horror stories. He published Dracula in 1897. Among Stoker’s other books are The Jewel of Seven Stars and The Lair of the White Worm.D. Thin was born in Grand Island, Nebraska, and studied in Paris.                        "

She recently left her dayjob as director of Legal Aid for the White Mountain Apache to reenter private law practice, and continues to teach history and legal advocacy part-time at the local community college. A fan of SF and fantasy since sixth grade, she began writing SF and fantasy during law school over twenty years ago, published several science-fiction novels in the early 90s, and is currently writing fantasy forTtor. Her first book in the witch of two suns series, Mother Ocean, Daughter Sea, appeared in September 2001, and the second book, The Sea Lark's Song, was published in December 2002, with the third book, Twilight Rising, due out in August 2004. She is currently working on the next book in her series as well as other writing projects. My life is an interesting combination, she says, of the very prosaic and people-oriented practice of law and the more solitary daydreaming of writing fantasy. My Apache friends are often after me to write Apache Tony Hillerman mysteries, but my first love is fantasy and SF, which I began reading as a girl and have never stopped. I first thought up my shari'a witch, Brierley Mefell, while in college, and she has lived in my imagination for over thirty years, much beloved, always fascinating. Other characters have appeared over the years to join the collection of people in my head, but Bri has been with me since the beginning and hers is a story I always wanted to write. Now, thanks to Tor, I have the wonderful privilege of living in Brierley's world, as least vicariously, as I write her ongoing story. Diana's interests include medieval history, practicing Wicca as a solitary witch, Apache tradition and culture, Zebra finches (she has a flock of fourteen), and needlework.                         "

He was the son of an Irish immigrant who had settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the prestigious Central High School, the second oldest public high school in the United States. There he studied under the presidency of John S. Hart, excelling primarily in literature. He then decided to become a lawyer, and became a clerk for Benjamin Brewster, who later became Attorney-General of the United States. He was admitted to the bar in 1852. In 1855, he married Katherine McCaffrey, with whom he had three children. In 1855, he resigned his clerkship, entered politics and participated in communal home building schemes. Together with several partners, he initiated a utopian community called Nininger City.                        "

In 2005, he received a BA in history and a secondary education credential from the State University of New York at Geneseo, and he traveled extensively throughout the United States and Mexico after graduating. These experiences have become the inspiration for much of his writing, which often explores themes of alienation and misery as human constructions that can be overcome through self-understanding and the acceptance of suffering. LaPoma has written four novels, twelve screenplays, and hundreds of songs and poems. His screenplays have won over 150 awards/honors at various international screenwriting competitions, and his black comedy script HARM FOR THE HOLIDAYS was optioned by Warren Zide along with Wexlfish Pictures (AMERICAN PIE, FINAL DESTINATION, THE BIG HIT) in July 2017. LaPoma's novels have been recommended by Kirkus Reviews and Barnes and Noble (B&N Press Presents list), have hit the #1 Amazon Bestseller lists in the Satire, Urban Life, Metaphysical, Metaphysical & Visionary, and Religious & Inspirational Kindle categories (USA, Canada, and Australia), and have won awards/honors in the 2018 Eric Hoffer Book Award, the 2016 and 2017 Florida Authors and Publishers Association President's Awards, and the 2015 Stargazer Literary Prizes.
